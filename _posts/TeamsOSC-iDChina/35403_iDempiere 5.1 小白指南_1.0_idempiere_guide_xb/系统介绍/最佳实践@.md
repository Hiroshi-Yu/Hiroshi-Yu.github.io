idempiere的最新源码的包依赖可能与一些老插件不一样。
或者你在某个版本，你想到另外一个版本去开发，你参考下面的链接：（仔细读）

https://idempiere.atlassian.net/browse/IDEMPIERE-2969 (每次基础库升级，都要注意补丁）

核心代码

register your own model factory

For example, if you have "com.abc.model.MRequisition" for "M_Requisition",

`public Class<?> getClass (String tableName) {
   if ("M_Requisition".equals(tableName)) {
     return com.abc.model.MRequisition.class;
   } else {
     return null;
   }
}

public PO getPO (String tableName, int Record_ID, String trxName) {
if ("M_Requisition".equals(tableName)) {
     return new com.abc.model.MRequisition(Env.getCtx(), Record_ID, trxName);
   } else {
     return null;
   }
}`

do not use extension points but OSGi Services
https://groups.google.com/d/msg/idempiere/AwxQ_TQJpzo/DF0DOMZ5sdEJ
It is not hard to run iDempiere in the Eclipse debugger. Then you can 
set a breakpoint on Core.getProcess() and see what happens. 

More often than I like I have the problem that a plugin is not activated 
really in the production environment. It can be not loaded, not 
activated or in a "lazy" state. If I suspect this issue I start 
iDempiere with an osgi console and use the "ss" command. Using the felix 
web console should also work. 

btw: **I do not use extension points but OSGi Services** for Processes and 
other Plugin things. AFAIR there is a recommendation from Heng Sin to 
use Services for future plugins and he deprecated the extensions 
interface. Please ask him if you need to be sure about this point. (Said 
that: I am sure this has nothing to do with your problems.) 

客户化代码

http://docs.metasfresh.org/developers_collection/en/de.metas.endcustomer.mf15.html

In de.metas.endcustomer.mf15 we take all the metasfresh projects and their artifacts and construct the distributables. Also see [developer_doc_getting_started] in order to better understand this process.

Note that mf15 is our internal “customer code” for the “metasfresh” project. For other customers or clients, we might have dedicated de.metas.endcustomer.ab12 repositories.

However, note that we put as little into any de.metas.endcustomer.ab12 project as we can, in order to avoid duplication and enable external contribution.

Usually, what goes into such an endcustomer project is mostly dedicated .properties files which we use as custom resource bundles in our jasper reports, and also some jasper reports, like dedicated shipping documents that only make sense for the respective customer or client.

First you need to know the table name. Generally in any window in iDempiere you can click the record info to know the table name of that tab (see image)
After you know the table name, you can find the java model class name by removing the prefix and adding "M" in the front. So C_OrderLine become MOrderLine, M_InOut become MInOut, C_BPartner become MBPartner, etc. You can find the class in eclipse using shortcut Ctrl+Shift+T.
You can check method beforeSave and afterSave of that model class if you want to know what the system doing when user insert a record (note the newRecord flag). Also you can check class PO (Persistent Object) to study more about how system save the data to database.
But if you want to do customization you don't want to change the model class directly. For that customization you can use Model Validator.
You can study more about Model Validator in the references below.
