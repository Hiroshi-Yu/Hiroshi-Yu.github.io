功能拓展

前言
---

无代码：（80%）
1. 新建表
2. 新建窗口
3. 新建菜单

后端业务开发：（20%）
1. callout ： 界面字段动态计算逻辑
2. ModelValidator：表间逻辑
3. process：业务逻辑流程
4. form：可能需要画一些窗体（java，zk）

开发技术：
1. Postgresql：存储过程，触发器
2. java：脚本，callout，流程等代码
3. javascript：自定义前端空间（zkoss使用jquery之类的库）

参考：wiki开发部分、cookbook、已有插件源码

存储过程

使用存储过程查询，而是不是修改数据，因为：

Hi Marco,

I can think about two main reasons:

1 - biggest point is about what Hiep noted here, wherever you do changes via SQL you're skipping ALL the business model of iDempiere
So, I guess that is something to consider when you add a trigger or a DB stored procedure, same issues as when you do import via direct SQL.
Plainly, when you skip the iDempiere model (f.e. PO class) you're missing all the stuff that PO manages:
- triggering workflows
- model validators (known and unknown from other plugins that you integrate but haven't studied the code)
- inserting/updating/deleting the trees associated with the table, and also accounting tables
- inserting/updating/deleting translations
- audit trail (AD_ChangeLog)
- model cascade delete
- encryption of columns
- assigning proper default values for certain columns (sometimes in beforeSave of model classes, but many also in PO like DocumentNo, Value, Created/Updated/By, ID, UUID, ProcessedOn for documents, etc)
- I've never used this - but PO can also manage replication
- dictionary validations (f.e. max and min values for numbers or dates
- cascade delete of lazy references with Table_ID+Record_ID (f.e. deleting Attachments when you delete a record)

You could write SQL code to mirror what you can do in PO class and dictionary, but who would like to do that?  And then try to maintain your SQL code in sync with the rules you change/add?

Of course there could be some cases where a trigger can be OK, validations are usually harmless, but based on the above I would say **changing data in triggers is a big NO-NO**.


2 - second point is about our multi-database architecture, we MUST maintain core with the less SQL dependencies as possible.
Any trigger we write in core would require maintenance in PL/SQL (oracle) and pl/pgsql (postgresql) and will make the implementation of new databases harder.
Even worst mentioning it requires testing in both platforms.
Same thing if you plan to make your plugins or customizations portable for oracle - maybe you don't have the need now - but is very common to find a prospect asking for oracle DB support.

My 2¢  :)

另外，触发器也尽量避免使用，或仅限于非业务逻辑。
The pros for trigger are well known and I'm not going to repeat here.

On the other hand, there are many cons with such approach too:
- Trigger are harder to write when complexities grow. It doesn't have the depth of library that Java has.
- It is harder to debug when you have both Java and Trigger making changes to the DB. Imaging you have to jump from your Java Debugger to Store Procedure Debugger, not a seamless experience.
- Trigger is harder to maintain and debug, Java have very mature tooling support.
- In medium to big setup, the DB is typically maintain by DBA and Java developer doesn't necessary have right to create DB trigger.
- For iDempiere, Context ( login role, warehouse, org, etc ) is very important and trigger doesn't have access to that.
- For iDempiere, change log ( AD_ChangeLog, if turn on ) is not maintain if changes is make through trigger.

Callout
---

规则脚本
---

Rules are a big security hole. 

接口类
---

自定义控件
---

自定义窗体
---

自定义流程
---

自定义单据
---

1. 在已有的主单据上新增子单据（比如，收发单上创建生产领料单）
2. 完全新建自定义的单据（比如，工时表timesheet）

总之：一张单据在id中需要一个表，一个M类，一个X类，一个I类，一个单据标准工作流记录，可选单据过账类。
比如：工时表（非系统核心表）
表：C_Timesheet，注意单据的特殊字段，参考[单据](/?t=134399#widget_6463376)
M类：MTimesheet.java ，自动生成
X类：X_Timesheet，自动生成
I类：I_Timesheet，自动生成
工作流记录：Process_Timesheet (开始-准备-完成，开始-自动）
过账类：Doc_Timesheet.java (定义你的分录逻辑)

自定义报表

自定义网店
---

网店，你可以新建N个。
拷贝默认的网店wstore目录到新目录。
修改web.xml ,比如plugins\org.adempiere.webstore_3.1.0.v20160606-0513\WEB-INF
编辑
<context-param>
  <param-name>#W_Store_ID</param-name>
  <param-value>1000001</param-value> 
 </context-param>
 <context-param>
  <param-name>#AD_Client_ID</param-name>
  <param-value>1000001</param-value>
 </context-param>
重启服务器
