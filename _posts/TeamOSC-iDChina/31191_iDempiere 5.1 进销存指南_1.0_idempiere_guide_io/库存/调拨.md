调拨
===

不同组织不同仓库
---

方案一：
1. 新建调拨单，选项=在途
2. 调出组织开始单据，生成调拨确认单。
3. 调入组织确认后，调拨单才可以完成。

方案二：
1. 新建中转仓库，选项=在途
2. 从调出组织仓库到中转仓库，完成调拨单
3. 运货中/中转中/检验中.....
4. 从中转仓库到调入组织，完成调拨单

I think there can be a way to solve that without code, not tested, just draft steps as the idea that I would try:
- create a view M_Locator_Auth_V based on M_Locator and changing the organization to those records that you want to show to users
- create the corresponding table on dictionary for that view
- create a reftable for that view
- overwrite the reference of the locator_to field  on window to point to this new reference -> reference=table, refkey=reference created -
